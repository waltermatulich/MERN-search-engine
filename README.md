The Book Search Engine is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the process of searching for books, managing user accounts, and organizing saved book lists. Upon loading the search engine, users are greeted with a menu offering the options to Search for Books and Login/Signup, accompanied by an input field and a submit button for initiating book searches. Clicking on the Search for Books menu option directs users to a search interface where they can explore various book titles, authors, descriptions, and images, with convenient links to access the corresponding books on the Google Books site.

For user convenience, the Login/Signup option triggers a modal window with toggles for either logging in or signing up. When signing up, users input their desired username, email address, and password, while the login option requires only the email address and password associated with their account. Once logged in, users can access additional features such as viewing their saved books, removing books from their lists, and logging out. The intuitive interface ensures a seamless experience, allowing users to efficiently manage their book searches and account preferences within the application.
